LangChain Integration Demo for LitKG-Integrate

This script demonstrates how LangChain enhances the LitKG system with:
1. Advanced document processing and retrieval
2. LLM-powered entity and relation extraction
3. Intelligent text chunking and vector storage
4. RAG-based literature queries
5. Confidence scoring with multiple model consensus

The integration shows significant improvements over the basic Phase 1 pipeline
by leveraging large language models and advanced retrieval techniques.

ABSTRACT
BRCA1 mutations are associated with increased risk of breast and ovarian cancer. This study investigates the therapeutic potential of PARP inhibitors in BRCA1-deficient tumors.

INTRODUCTION  
Breast cancer susceptibility gene 1 (BRCA1) plays a crucial role in DNA repair mechanisms. Mutations in BRCA1 lead to defective homologous recombination repair, creating synthetic lethality opportunities with PARP inhibition.

METHODS
We conducted in vitro studies using BRCA1-deficient cell lines treated with olaparib, a PARP inhibitor. Cell viability was assessed using MTT assays. Statistical analysis was performed using Student's t-test.

RESULTS
BRCA1-deficient cells showed significantly increased sensitivity to olaparib treatment compared to wild-type cells (p < 0.001). IC50 values were 10-fold lower in BRCA1-deficient lines.

DISCUSSION
Our findings support the clinical use of PARP inhibitors in BRCA1-mutated breast cancers. The synthetic lethality approach represents a promising precision medicine strategy.

CONCLUSION
PARP inhibitors demonstrate selective efficacy against BRCA1-deficient tumor cells, providing a rational therapeutic approach for hereditary breast cancers.
